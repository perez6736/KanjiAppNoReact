What do i want to do that might need a DB?? 
- I want to eventually support users and have them search there most frequent Kanjis. 
- I want to be able to show the user a history of all the kanji they have ran into 

Tables I might need in order to do this. 

Users Table 
- ID
- username
- pw (encrpyed)
- first name 
- last name 
- email 

UsersKanji Table - will store the kanji the user has seen. 
- ID
- Kanji
- UserID - foreign key 

Kanji table is being replaced with xml file with over 6000 kanji characters with tons of info on that kanji.
