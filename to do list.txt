First thing to do. 
read directly from xml ( maybe easier. )

write a get request to get info on a kanji 
write a get request to get info on a list of kanji 
write a get request to get info on all kanji 
write a get request to get info based on the english of a kanji

write a put request to add new kanji into the db 
make sure you cant put if fields are missing 

write a delete request to remove kanji into the db (bonus only be able to delete added kanji)
this is a bonus and may not need but will be maybe useful idk.
