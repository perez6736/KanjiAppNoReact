when i enter japanese text what happens. 

The kanji will be added to kanji db 
- I need to support users for these to functionalities - 
link to kanji and user will be made to kanji users table 
csv flag will be set to 0 (0 means not uploaded to csv) 


- suport logging in with gmail or fb - in the future 

- create a registration page 
-- needs username / pw  and email field 
-- when user submits data need to encode the pw and store encoding into db 


-- thoughts and things learnt 
--- model files are typically used per controller or business need.
--- any db interaction i need for that will go into models wehre i can use it later. 
--- sanatizing SQL input is important. need to learn a better solution but I did works for now/

-- next step to do 
--- redirect users who are not logged in to login page. 
--- registration for new users. 
    - need to encrypt passwords for users. 
    - confirmation email should be used as well. 
--- fix current bug with kanji update 
--- refactor the frontjs.js page.. its a damn shame at the moment..
